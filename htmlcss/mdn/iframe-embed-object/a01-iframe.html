        <p>Once the winter weather<br />
            passes by the mind<br />
            A little warmth inside us<br />
            start to show It's kind<br />
            Even if I try to think<br />
            of the better times<br />
            It just hurts me more<br />
            but I feel so alive<br />
            Where’s my love<br />
            It used to be so alive<br />
            You were really all that I got<br />
            When the time<br />
            ended for you and I<br />
            It made a little void in my mind<br />
            I don’t want your love<br />
            All we did was fuck<br />
            Everytime I think of you<br />
            It’s just killing me<br />
            Why’d you have to leave<br />
            Why’d you have to be<br />
            I don’t want your<br />
            broken love<br />
            No more<br />
            Broken love<br />
            I’m so broken<br />
            Still breaking<br />
            with<br />
            all this love<br />
            I was stolen<br />
            Then woken<br />
            by all the memories<br />
            Like a fire<br />
            네 폰을 불태웠던 난<br />
            이제 수많은 밤을 태우고 떠나<br />
            Stay up all night<br />
            난 네가 아닌 누군가<br />
            달군 밤은 다시 차가워져만 가<br />
            I don’t want your love<br />
            All we did was fuck<br />
            Everytime I think of you<br />
            It’s just killing me<br />
            Why’d you have to leave<br />
            Why’d you have to be<br />
            I don’t want your<br />
            broken love<br />
            No more<br />
            Broken love<br />
            I’m so broken<br />
            still breaking<br />
            with<br />
            all this love<br />
            I was stolen<br />
            Then woken<br />
            by all the memories</p>
